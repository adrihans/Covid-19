# Covid-19
Project based on the Kaggle's [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)


## Final aspect of this project: 
You can visualize the final Dashboard [here](https://adrihans.github.io/Covid-19/) or in the *index.html* file.

**Disclaimer:** Since almost every callback functions have been written in Python, the notebook must be run to obtain the complete functionnalities of the Dashboard. Opening the html of the [link](https://adrihans.github.io/Covid-19/) only permits to have a general visualization of the Dashboard.


At the end, the result looks like this:

## Technical points:

- TF-IDF based representation of the text
- Retrieving information based on cosine similarity
- Representation in 2D of the articles with dimensionnality reduction, considering several techniques
- free text search and answers to the tasks presented by Kaggle
